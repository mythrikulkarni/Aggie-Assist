Mental health is a critical issue for college students, and UC Davis is no exception. According to the UC Davis Mental Health Care Task Force, nearly half (49%) of undergraduate students surveyed reported experiencing depression so severe that it significantly affected their ability to function. Additionally, demand for mental health services at UC Davis has been increasing over the past few years, and wait times for counseling appointments can be lengthy.

Given this situation, there is a clear need for a student mental health support system that can provide personalized and confidential support to students, while also identifying trends and patterns in student mental health issues to inform campus policies and resource allocation. By using machine learning, such a system could provide personalized support to individual students based on their unique needs and experiences. For example, if a particular group of students is experiencing high levels of stress or anxiety, machine learning algorithms could identify this trend and allocate more resources to support that group specifically.

Furthermore, machine learning can play a key role in identifying early warning signs of mental health issues, enabling early intervention and support. By analyzing patterns in mental health data, machine learning algorithms can alert counselors or other mental health professionals to potential issues before they become more severe. This could help to prevent students from reaching the point of being unable to function due to their mental health.

Overall, by leveraging machine learning techniques to provide personalized support and identify trends in student mental health issues, a mental health support system for UC Davis students could help to improve their academic performance and overall well-being. The system will provide personalized mental health support to UC Davis undergraduate students by collecting data about their mental health and providing them with resources and guidance based on their unique needs and experiences. The system will also identify trends and patterns in student mental health issues to inform campus policies and resource allocation.
We envisioned this to be a language model first and foremost, so we used deep learning frameworks and libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch build and train the language model. We also used pre-built models and libraries such as Hugging Face's Transformers to speed up development. We trained a machine learning model, using the preprocessed data, Google's BERT AI language model, and the defined features.
