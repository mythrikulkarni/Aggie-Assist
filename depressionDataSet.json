   "Questions": "What does it mean to have a mental illness?",
   "Answers": "Mental illness is a medical condition that can affect a person's thoughts, emotions, and behavior, making it challenging to carry out daily activities. It's important to recognize that mental illness is not a sign of weakness or a lack of intelligence, but rather the result of biological changes in the brain. Mental illnesses vary in severity, ranging from mild conditions like phobias to more serious disorders like major depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia, which may require hospitalization. However, with proper treatment, individuals with mental illness can lead fulfilling lives. Treatment may involve medication, therapy, or a combination of both, along with social support. It's encouraging to know that 70-90% of people who receive treatment for mental illness experience an improvement in symptoms and quality of life. It's crucial to remember that seeking help for mental illness is a sign of strength and courage, and resources are available on campus and in the community for those who need support."

   "Questions": "Who does mental illness affect?",
   "Answers": "Mental illness affects a significant portion of the American population, with estimates suggesting that 1 in 5 adults and 1 in 24 adults experience a serious mental illness. Mental illness is indiscriminate, affecting people from all walks of life regardless of gender, age, income, social status, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or background. However, certain mental health conditions may be more prevalent in certain populations. For example, eating disorders are more common in females, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder tends to affect children. Mental illnesses can occur at any age, but they often manifest in the prime of a person's life, with 75% of mental health conditions developing by age 24. This can make it difficult to recognize and treat mental health issues, particularly in young people, as symptoms may be masked by normal personality and behavioral changes during adolescence. It's important for parents and caretakers to be aware of this and to pay attention to changes in a child's mood, personality, habits, or social withdrawal. In cases where these changes occur in children under 18, they are referred to as serious emotional disturbances (SEDs). Resources are available on campus and in the community to help those affected by mental illness, and seeking help is a sign of strength and self-care."

   "Question_ID": 6361820,
   "Questions": "What causes mental illness?",
   "Answers": "The causes of mental illness are complex and can vary greatly depending on the individual and the specific condition. Some mental illnesses may be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors, while others may have a more clear-cut biological basis. For example, conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are believed to have a strong genetic component, while anxiety disorders may be triggered by traumatic life events or a chemical imbalance in the brain. Other factors that may contribute to the development of mental illness include chronic stress, substance abuse, and a history of trauma or abuse. Additionally, societal and cultural factors, such as discrimination or lack of access to mental health care, can also play a role in the onset and progression of mental illness. It's important to note that while certain factors may increase the likelihood of developing a mental illness, having these risk factors does not necessarily mean that someone will develop a mental illness. Likewise, not having any risk factors does not guarantee that someone will not develop a mental illness. Mental illness is a complex and multi-faceted issue, and further research is needed to better understand the causes and effective treatments."

 {
   "Question_ID": 3388962,
   "Questions": "What should I know before starting a new medication?",
   "Answers": "The best source of information regarding medications is the physician prescribing them. He or she should be able to answer questions such as:    1. What is the medication supposed to do? 2. When should it begin to take effect, and how will I know when it is effective? 3. How is the medication taken and for how long? What food, drinks, other medicines, and activities should be avoided while taking this medication? 4. What are the side effects and what should be done if they occur? 5. What do I do if a dose is missed? 6. Is there any written information available about this medication? 7. Are there other medications that might be appropriate? 8. If so, why do you prefer the one you have chosen? 9. How do you monitor medications and what symptoms indicate that they should be raised, lowered, or changed? 10. All medications should be taken as directed. Most medications for mental illnesses do not work when taken irregularly, and extra doses can cause severe, sometimes dangerous side effects. Many psychiatric medications begin to have a beneficial effect only after they have been taken for several weeks."

 {
   "Question_ID": 5343181,
   "Questions": "If I feel better after taking medication, does this mean I am \"cured\" and can stop taking it?",
   "Answers": "It is not uncommon for people to stop taking their medication when they feel their symptoms are under control. Others may choose to stop taking their medication because of its side effects, without realizing that most side effects can be effectively managed. While it may seem reasonable to stop taking the medication, the problem is that most often, the symptoms will return. If you or your child is taking medication, it is very important that you work together with your doctor before making decisions about any changes in your treatment.\\nAnother problem with stopping medication, particularly for stopping it abruptly, is that you may develop withdrawal symptoms that can be very unpleasant. If you and your doctor feel a trial off your medicine is a good idea, it is necessary to slowly decrease the dosage of medications so that these symptoms don’t occur.\\nIt is important that your doctor and pharmacist work together to make sure your medications are working safely and effectively. You should talk with them about how you are doing and if there are side effects that make you unwilling to continue treatment. They will work with you to develop strategies for minimizing these side effects, or will create a plan for switching to a different treatment that will be a better fit."

   "Question_ID": 5778437,
   "Questions": "How can I get help paying for my medication?",
   "Answers": "UC Ship (University of California Student Health Insurance Plan) typically provides coverage for prescription medications. However, the specifics of the coverage may vary depending on the plan and the medication. It's important to check the plan details and formulary (list of covered medications) to see what medications are covered and what costs or restrictions may apply. Additionally, some medications may require prior authorization or step therapy, which means that your doctor may need to provide additional information to the insurance company before the medication will be covered. It's always a good idea to check with the insurance company or the pharmacy to confirm coverage and any associated costs."

 {
   "Question_ID": 4181750,
   "Questions": "How can I tell if health information is good or bad?",
   "Answers": "Anyone can post anything online. It's up to the readers to think critically about information to decide if it seems helpful, truthful, or safe. Here are key points to keep in mind as you determine which information is worth considering and which information doesn't pass the test. \n It's so easy to spread information online, and we can't assume that the source we're reading or watching is the original source. Before you can evaluate anything, you need to know where the claims come from and determine if it's a reliable source. \n Reliable sources on the coronavirus and COVID-19 illness include the World Health Organization (WHO), different US governement agencies including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC), and well-known universities (including any in the UC system). Scientists and researchers at universities and other institutions and health sciences professionals are also important sources of information. \n Headlines and titles need to be simple and short, so they can sometimes be misleading on their own. They may also be purposefully shocking or controversial to entice you to click to read more. \n Websites that belong to governments, government-funded agencies, well-known health providers, universities, or groups of medical professionals are generally the most reliable. Be careful of sites that don't list the author or don't tell you much about themselves. Double-check the author and the credentials of any 'experts' quoted or cited to see if they are actually experts in the topic being discussed. \n Can you find other evidence from other sources to support the claims? Does the author list their sources? Are the sources legitimate, like research journals? \n Unhelpful sources want you to feel a certain way: scared, angry, distrustful, vulnerable. Phrases like \"Skyrocketing rates of infection\" are sensational and they're meant to make people feel afraid. On the other hand, factual statements like \"We have 50 new cases in BC\" give you important information without playing into your emotions. Helpful news or information sources want you feel informed and empowered. \n Who is paying for the site? What products or services are being advertised? What links or other sites do they promote? Are you learning something from a story or experience, or are you simply being directed to buy a product or service? \n Social media can be a great way to keep in touch with family and friends, especially as we practice physical distancing or self-isolation. Social media can also be an important way to learn from health experts and connect to support services and mutual aid groups in your community. \n Like any other source of information, it's important to use good critical thinking skills when you use social media. Studies find that searching for health information on social media generally has very mixed results. You'll see both very poor-quality sources next to good-quality sources, and it's up to you to decide which is which. In addition, social media posts tend to be short and rarely capture everything you need to consider. They are generally useful as a way to start learning or exploring different points of view rather than a place to gather all the information. \n Visit www.mediasmarts.ca to learn more about digital and media literacy \n Visit www.healthnewsreview.org to learn more about thinking critically around health claims (this resource is no longer updated daily, but all toolkits and lessons are still available) \n This page is adapted from the Evaluating Mental Health and Substance Use Information info sheet."

 {
   "Question_ID": 3597720,
   "Questions": "How can I reframe the situation and find more balanced perspectives?",
   "Answers": "How you think about something impacts your feelings and your behaviours. \n When we feel stressed out, angry, or fearful, it's hard to look at the situation realistically and see all of the options we have. (Remember: we all control our own actions and reactions, no matter what's going on in the world. We can call do something about this pandemic.) \n People often overestimate the negative parts—their own feelings, their own abilities to manage a difficult situation, or the situation itself—and underestimate positive parts—their own abilities to care for themselves and loved ones, their support networks, and opportunities. \n How does the thought \"We're never going to make it through this!\" make you feel? It likely doesn't feel good—and it isn't even true. \n Challenging negative, unhelpful thoughts can improve your mood, validate your ability to get through this, and help you see new options or opportunities to stay well. \n Stop and notice thoughts that come up. How do they make you feel? Do your thoughts seem realistic if you look at the situation more objectively? How can you reframe the thought to make it more productive or hopeful? Can you find any positive aspects or think of new ways to approach the situation? \n Here are a few example: \n \"I'm so mad that my event was cancelled! This sucks!\" \n \"I know this is the safer option for everyone. When it's rescheduled, I'll enjoy it more because I won't have to worry about getting sick or spreading the illness.\" \n \"I hate spending so much time at home. This is so boring.\" \n \"I'm doing my part to keep my neighbours safe. It's worth it because it keeps people healthy.\" \n \"I'm having a hard time getting used to my new schedule. This is so frustrating.\" \n \"I'll get used to this soon, just like I adapted the last time I had to change my schedule. Now that I'm home more, I'll have more time to finish the projects I haven't touched in months and I'm excited to see the end results. \n \"I'm really scared and I don't know what to do. I feel so overwhelmed right now.\" \n \"It makes sense that I feel scared—people are getting sick and we don't know when things will go back to normal. But there are a lot of things I can do to keep healthy, and I'm going to do some research so I can do my best. When I focus on the things I can do, everything feels more manageable.\" \n \"We're going to be stuck inside forever. I'm already sick of this.\" \n \"I understand that it will take some time to manage COVID-19, and I trust that health care professionals and scientists are working as fast as they can. I know this will end eventually and life will go back to normal.\" \n The goal is not to ignore the bad or uncomfortable parts of the situation or deny that there's a problem. Instead, this exercise can help you understand the situation more realistically and see the parts that you can control right now."

However, when you interpret situations too negatively, you might feel worse. You're also more likely to respond to the situation in ways that are unhelpful in the long term. \n These automatic thoughts and assumptions are sometimes called thinking traps. Everyone falls into unbalanced thinking traps from time to time. You're most likely to distort your interpretation of things when you already feel sad, angry, anxious, depressed or stressed. You're also more vulnerable to thinking traps when you're not taking good care of yourself, like when you're not eating or sleeping well. \n Here are some common thinking traps: \n Thinking that a negative situation is part of a constant cycle of bad things that happen. People who overgeneralize often use words like \"always\" or \"never.\" \n I was really looking forward to that concert, and now it’s cancelled. This always happens to me! I never get to do fun things! \n Seeing things as only right or wrong, good or bad, perfect or terrible. People who think in black and white terms see a small mistake as a total failure. \n I wanted to eat healthier, but I ate too many snacks today. This plan is a total failure! \n Saying only negative things about yourself or other people. \n I made a mistake. I'm stupid! My boss told me that I made a mistake. My boss is a total jerk! \n Predicting that something bad will happen without any evidence. \n I've been doing what I can to stay home and reduce the risks, but I just know that I'm going to get sick. \n Focusing only on the negative parts of a situation and ignoring anything good or positive. \n I know there's a lot I can do at home, but I'm just so sick of this. Everything is terrible. \n Believing that bad feelings or emotions reflect the situation. \n I feel scared and overwhelmed right now, so that must mean everything is very bad and will never get better. \n Telling yourself how you \"should\" or \"must\" act. \n I should be able to handle this without getting upset and crying! \n Here are helpful strategies to challenge common thinking traps. Many people find their mood and confidence improve after working through these skills. You can also find worksheets to help you go through each step at www.heretohelp.bc.ca. \n Don't try to get out of a thinking trap by just telling yourself to stop thinking that way. \n This doesn't let you look at the evidence and challenge the thinking trap. When you try and push upsetting thoughts away, they are more likely to keep popping back into your mind. \n Ask yourself the following questions when something upsetting happens: \n What is the situation? What actually happened? Only include facts that everyone would agree on. \n What are your thoughts? What are you telling yourself? \n What are your emotions? How do you feel? \n What are your behaviours? How are you reacting? What are you doing to cope? \n Take a look at the thoughts you've listed. Are you using any of the thinking traps and falling into distorted thinking patterns? It's common to fall into more than one thinking trap. Go back to the thinking trap list and identify which ones apply to you and your current situation. \n The best way to break a thinking trap is to look at your thoughts like a scientist and consider the hard facts. Use the evidence you've collected to challenge your thinking traps. Here are some ways to do that: \n Try to find evidence against the thought. If you make a mistake at work, you might automatically think, \"I can't do anything right! I must be a terrible employee!\" When this thought comes up, you might challenge it by asking, \"Is there any evidence to support this thought? Is there any evidence to disprove this thought?\" You might quickly realize that your boss has complimented your work recently, which doesn't support the idea that you're a bad employee. \n Ask yourself, \"Would I judge other people if they did the same thing? Am I being harder on myself than I am on other people?\" This is a great method for challenging thinking traps that involve harsh self-criticism. \n Find out whether other people you trust agree with your thoughts. For example, you might have trouble with one of your kids and think, \"Good parents wouldn't have this kind of problem.\" To challenge this thought, you can ask other parents if they've ever had any problems with their kids. \n Test your beliefs in person. For example, if you think that your friends don't care about you, call a few friends and make plans to start a regular video call. If you assumed that they will all say no, you may be pleasantly surprised to hear that they do want to see you. \n Once you have worked through some challenges, try to think of a more balanced thought to replace the old thinking traps. Let's use the following example: \n I feel sad and overwhelmed. I'm having a hard time figuring out what to do. \n I'm the worst! I should be able to handle this! \n Labeling \n 'Should' statements \n Examine the evidence: I have a lot of challenges right now. I'm worried about my family and everything seems to change so quickly. I've successfully handled complicated situations in the past, so I know I can do this. \n It's okay to feel upset right now—there's a lot going on. I'm going to think about how I got through past situations and see what worked for me. I'm trying to do a lot on my own, so I'm going to talk to my family so we can make a plan and work together. \n Try the Healthy Thinking Worksheet at www.heretohelp.bc.ca \n Check out Anxiety Canada's articles Helpful Thinking and Thinking Traps \n This page is adapted from Wellness Module 8: Healthy Thinking at www.heretohelp.bc.ca/wellness-module/wellness-module-8-healthy-thinking."

   "Questions": "How can I manage grief?",
   "Answers": "Grief is a normal and natural, although sometimes deeply painful, response to loss that is experienced by everyone at sometime in their lives. The death of a loved one is the most common way we think of loss, but many other significant changes in one's life can involve loss and therefore grief. The more significant the loss, the more intense the grief is likely to be.\n\nEach individual experiences and expresses grief differently. For example, one person may withdraw and feel helpless, while another might be angry and want to take some action. No matter what the reaction, the grieving person needs the support of others. Dealing with Your Grief\nAllow time to experience thoughts and feelings openly to self. \nAcknowledge and accept all feelings, both positive and negative. \nUse a journal to document the healing process.\nConfide in a trusted individual; tell the story of the loss. \nExpress feelings openly. Crying offers a release.\nIdentify any unfinished business and try to come to a resolution. \nBereavement groups provide an opportunity to share grief with others who have experienced similar loss.\n\nSHCS provides urgent care, drop-in services, brief individual therapy, group therapy, and referrals for on-going therapy. \nYou can schedule an intake with a counselor at North Hall by calling (530) 752-2349. Urgent Care drop-in services are available on the first floor of the Student Health and Wellness Center.\n"

   "Answers": "Mental health concerns are a serious concern at any age, and everyone deserves help and support. If you’re concerned about your mental health, you can: \n Talk to your family doctor or go to a walk-in clinic \n Call the Mental Health Support Line at 310-6789 (no area code) for information about services in your area \n Find your local mental health centre or program at www.gov.bc.ca/mentalhealth (you may need a doctor’s referral to access some programs) \n Find your local Canadian Mental Health Association branch at www.cmha.bc.ca and ask for information about local services \n Contact a local senior’s support organization or group and ask for advice. You can search for organizations at www.bc211.ca \n For general information about senior’s mental health: \n Find resources from the Canadian Coalition for Seniors' Mental Health at www.ccsmh.ca \n Find info sheets in the Seniors and Depression Series at www.heretohelp.bc.ca/factsheet/seniors-and-depression-series \n If you are concerned about a loved one: \n Be honest about your concerns, like changes you’ve noticed or problems that have come up \n Give your loved one a chance to talk about their perspectives. They may have a different take on the problem or have different priorities in their health care \n Be patient—it will probably take more than one conversation \n Whenever possible, aim for cooperation. Focus on finding an action or solution that everyone can agree on \n Remember that asking for help is hard for many of us, and it can be even harder as people’s roles and abilities change. If your loved one isn’t willing to talk about their experiences with you right away, offer alternatives like the BC Mental Health Support Line (310-6789—no area code needed), the Seniors Distress Line (604-872-1234) or a local seniors support organization (search for organizations at www.bc211.ca) \n Seek support to manage your expectations and your own well-being. It can be very stressful to see a loved one experience health problems. But adults who can care for themselves and aren’t at risk of harm are free to make their own choices—and that includes refusing help"

You may need to meet certain criteria, like a specific diagnosis or specific symptoms, to access some specialists. Your doctor can tell you what to expect. \n Once your doctor has made the referral, the specialist’s office will contact you with an appointment time. Make sure your doctor’s office has your current contact information so the specialist can reach you. \n The process is the same whether you see the same family doctor or visit a walk-in clinic. \n Not all mental health programs in BC require a doctor’s referral. This is good news for people who are looking for help! A \"self-referral\" means that you ask to see someone, and then you will be evaluated to see if you meet the criteria to receive services.

   "Question_ID": 6851366,
   "Questions": "What's the difference between a psychiatrist and a registered psychologist?",
   "Answers": "A psychiatrist is a medical doctor with extra training in mental health who can choose to prescribe medications. Some use psychotherapy (‘talk therapies’) approaches like cognitive-behavioural therapy to treat mental health problems. Many psychiatrists work at hospitals, clinics, or health centres, and some have a private office. As they are specialist doctors, you will almost always need another doctor’s referral to see a psychiatrist, and fees are covered by MSP. If you have a valid BC Services or CareCard, you do not need to pay to see a psychiatrist. \n A registered psychologist focuses on different talk therapy or counselling approaches to treatments, but they don’t prescribe medication. They have graduate degrees in psychology. There are two different ways to access registered psychologists: the public system and the private system. Registered psychologists in the public system work in some hospitals or schools. You may need a doctor’s referral to access the program, and costs are usually covered by MSP. However, most people need to access registered psychologists through the private system. To do this, you can contact the psychologist yourself—you do not need a referral. Costs are not covered by MSP, but they may be covered by employee health plans. A registered psychologist’s fees charged by hour vary, and some offer lower fees to people with lower incomes. \n You’ve probably noticed that a lot of the differences come down to how you pay for different services and how these professionals are educated. The practical differences in how they work are not always so clear. When it comes to your treatment and care, the most important part is finding a professional who supports your own goals. Are you really focused on fine-tuning medications? Are you looking for a particular therapy approach? Does the professional’s philosophy of care make sense to you? Do you like the professional you’re talking to and do you feel safe sharing your experiences? Ultimately, your relationship with the professional is what matters. Instead of focusing on designation, look for a professional who meets your needs and your expectations. \n Talk to your family doctor and ask for their recommendations \n Ask local mental health organizations for help. You can find local branches through the provincial organizations behind HeretoHelp \n Ask a community health centre, outpatient psychiatry program, or mental health team for suggestions \n For a list of psychiatrists near you, search under ‘Specialist’ in the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia’s Find a Physician Tool but remember that you will first need a referral from a doctor (like your family doctor) \n For a list of psychologists near you, search in the British Columbia Psychological Association’s Find a Registered Psychologist tool and you can also learn more about finding a psychologist from the College of Psychologists of British Columbia"

   "Questions": "What's the difference between psychotherapy and counselling?",
   "Answers": "Psychotherapy and counselling have a lot in common and usually mean the same thing. Both are used to describe professionals who use talk-based approaches to help someone recover from a mental illness or mental health problem. Many different professionals may provide counselling or psychotherapy, including registered psychologists, registered clinical counsellors, psychiatrists, other therapists and counsellors, family doctors, psychiatric nurses, and faith leaders. \n It’s useful to talk to someone about any problem—a lot of people find that simply talking with friends or family can help them feel better. A professional therapist or counsellor can offer more: they have training, experience, and emotional distance (since they don’t know you). They use different theories to listen to you, support you, and approach different problems or patterns. For example, a psychotherapy called cognitive-behavioural therapy is based on the theory that learning skills to change your thinking and actions can positively impact your emotions, well-being, and future thoughts and behaviours. A therapist could help you learn and practice these skills. \n There are many psychotherapies with good evidence of being effective for different problems or illnesses. A few examples include cognitive-behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy, dialectical behaviour therapy, solutions-focused brief psychotherapy, narrative therapy, and emotion-focused therapy. \n In general, some aspects of therapy and counselling are the same, no matter which approach you choose: the expectations you bring to your counselling sessions, the match between your understanding of the problems and your therapist’s understanding of the problem, and the trust and rapport that you have with your therapist. In fact, one research review found that 50% of the improvement seen in clients who just received active listening and support from a counsellor (called non-directive supportive therapy) was due simply to the relationship between client and therapist.1 Psychotherapy can and does work, but the professional you choose, and their match with your values, is also very important. \n When you’re looking for a professional, it’s always a good idea to ask if they are a member of a professional organization (like those listed in the next section)."

   "Answers": "CBT stands for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, while DBT stands for Dialectical Behavioral Therapy.\n\nCBT is a type of therapy that focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors that can contribute to mental health problems. It is often used to treat conditions such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. CBT can help individuals learn new coping strategies and develop more positive ways of thinking.\n\nOn the other hand, DBT is a type of therapy that was originally developed to treat borderline personality disorder, but it has been found to be effective in treating a range of other conditions as well. DBT combines elements of CBT with mindfulness techniques and acceptance-based strategies. The goal of DBT is to help individuals learn how to regulate their emotions, develop healthier relationships, and improve their overall quality of life.\n\nIn summary, while both CBT and DBT are types of therapy that can help individuals address mental health issues, DBT places a greater emphasis on mindfulness and acceptance-based strategies, whereas CBT focuses more on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors."

   "Questions": "What's the difference between antidepressants?",
   "Answers": "Antidepressants are a class of medications used to treat depression and other mental health conditions. There are several different types of antidepressants, and each works in a slightly different way.\n\nThe main types of antidepressants are:\n\n1. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs): These drugs work by increasing the levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain. Some common SSRIs include fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and escitalopram (Lexapro).\n\n2. Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs): These drugs work by increasing the levels of both serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain. Some common SNRIs include venlafaxine (Effexor) and duloxetine (Cymbalta).\n\n3. Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs): These drugs were some of the first antidepressants developed, and they work by increasing the levels of both serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain. They are less commonly prescribed now due to their potential side effects. Some common TCAs include amitriptyline and nortriptyline.\n\n4. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs): These drugs work by blocking the action of an enzyme called monoamine oxidase, which breaks down serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain. MAOIs are also less commonly prescribed now due to their potential side effects and interactions with certain foods and medications.\n\n5. Atypical Antidepressants: This is a miscellaneous group of antidepressants that work in different ways than the other types. Some common atypical antidepressants include bupropion (Wellbutrin) and mirtazapine (Remeron).\n\nEach type of antidepressant has its own unique benefits and potential side effects. The choice of medication will depend on the individual's specific symptoms and medical history, and it is typically made in consultation with a mental health professional.\n\nIf you would like to speak with a professional about anidepressant options or would like to learn more about them, visit https://shcs.ucdavis.edu/health-topic/medication.

   "Answers": "If you have received a diagnosis that you don't think is accurate, it's important to talk to your healthcare provider about your concerns. Here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. Ask questions: If you have doubts about your diagnosis, ask your healthcare provider to explain the reasoning behind it. Ask for more information about the symptoms you're experiencing and why they led to the diagnosis.\n\n2. Get a second opinion: You can consider seeking a second opinion from another healthcare provider, especially if you're still experiencing symptoms or you're not comfortable with the initial diagnosis. Be sure to bring any medical records or test results to the appointment to help the new provider understand your situation.\n\n3. Advocate for yourself: Be open and honest with your healthcare provider about your concerns, and don't be afraid to advocate for yourself. If you don't feel comfortable with a diagnosis or treatment plan, speak up and ask for alternatives.\n\n4. Seek support: Receiving a diagnosis can be overwhelming, so it's important to seek support from friends, family, or a therapist who can help you process your feelings and navigate the healthcare system.\n\nRemember, it's important to be an active participant in your own healthcare.

   "Answers": "If you've been prescribed an antidepressant or other psychiatric medication and you don't think it's working, it's important to talk to your healthcare provider about your concerns. Here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. Give it time: It's important to remember that it can take several weeks for some medications to take effect. Give the medication a chance to work and try to be patient. However, if you've been taking the medication for several weeks and you're not seeing any improvement, it may be time to speak with your healthcare provider.\n\n2. Be honest with your healthcare provider: If you're not experiencing any improvement or you're experiencing side effects, it's important to be honest with your healthcare provider. They may need to adjust the dosage or switch you to a different medication. Don't stop taking your medication or change your dosage without first consulting with your healthcare provider.\n\n3. Consider therapy: Medications are often used in conjunction with therapy to treat mental health conditions.

   "Questions": "An adult in my life seems ill and won’t find help. What can I do?",
   "Answers": "If an adult in your life seems ill and is unwilling to seek help, it can be a difficult and complex situation to handle. Here are some steps you can take to support them:\n\n1. Express your concern: Let the person know that you care about them and that you're worried about their health. Use \"I\" statements to avoid sounding accusatory, such as \"I'm concerned about you\" or \"I care about your well-being.\"\n\n2. Educate yourself: Research the signs and symptoms of the person's condition, and learn about the available treatment options. This will help you understand the person's perspective and offer informed suggestions for seeking help.\n\n3. Offer support: Encourage the person to seek professional help, but offer to support them in the process. You can offer to help them find a healthcare provider or accompany them to appointments. It's important to respect the person's autonomy, but also let them know that they don't have to go through it alone.\n\n4. Set boundaries: If the person is unwilling to seek help or is resistant to your suggestions, it's important to set boundaries to protect your own well-being. Let them know that you're available to support them, but also let them know what you can and can't tolerate in terms of their behavior or actions.\n\n5. Seek help yourself: Caring for someone with an illness can be emotionally draining, so it's important to seek support for yourself as well. Consider reaching out to a therapist, support group, or other resources for caregivers.\n\nRemember, ultimately, it's up to the person to decide whether or not they want to seek help. You can offer support and encouragement, but you can't force someone to get help. By expressing your concern, educating yourself, offering support, setting boundaries, and seeking help for yourself, you can navigate this complex situation with compassion and empathy. In times of crisis, call 530-752-0871 or visit SHCS's Acute Care Clinic. "

   "Answers": "It is true that cannabis is legal for individuals over the age of 21 in California, but there is ongoing debate among healthcare professionals about the potential risks associated with cannabis use, particularly for individuals under the age of 25. Here are some facts and myths to consider:\n\nMyth: Cannabis is harmless and non-addictive.\n\nFact: Cannabis use can have potential risks and negative effects on physical and mental health, especially when used frequently or in high doses. Studies have shown that cannabis use can impact brain development, particularly in individuals under the age of 25. Additionally, while cannabis use may not be physically addictive, it can lead to psychological dependence and can be a risk factor for developing other substance use disorders.\n\nMyth: Cannabis is a safe alternative to prescription drugs for managing health conditions.\n\nFact: While some studies have shown that cannabis can have therapeutic benefits for certain medical conditions, more research is needed to determine the long-term effects and potential risks associated with regular cannabis use for medical purposes. Additionally, using cannabis as a substitute for prescription drugs without the guidance of a healthcare professional can be dangerous and potentially harmful.\n\nMyth: All forms of cannabis use are equally harmful.\n\nFact: The method of cannabis use can impact the potential risks and negative effects on physical and mental health. Smoking or vaping cannabis can have negative effects on lung health, while edible cannabis products can have unpredictable effects due to variations in dosage and absorption.\n\nIf you are concerned about your cannabis use or are unsure about the potential risks associated with cannabis use, there are resources available to help you make informed decisions. \n\n1. UC Davis Student Health and Counseling Services (SHCS) provides confidential counseling and support services for UC Davis students who are struggling with substance use or other mental health concerns.\n\n2.

   "Questions": "What's the difference between mental health and mental illness?",
   "Answers": "‘Mental health’ and ‘mental illness’ are increasingly being used as if they mean the same thing, but they do not. Everyone has mental health, just like everyone has health. As the World Health Organization famously says, “There is no health without mental health.” In the course of a lifetime, not all people will experience a mental illness, but everyone will struggle or have a challenge with their mental well-being (i.e., their mental health) just like we all have challenges with our physical well-being from time to time. \n When we talk about mental health, we’re talking about our mental well-being: our emotions, our thoughts and feelings, our ability to solve problems and overcome difficulties, our social connections, and our understanding of the world around us. \n A mental illness is an illness the affects that way people think, feel, behave, or interact with others. There are many different mental illnesses, and they have different symptoms that impact peoples’ lives in different ways. \n Health isn’t like an on/off switch. There are different degrees of health. People move on a continuum ranging from great or good health to so-so health to poor health to illness or disability. For example, some people have good health and have no problems going about their lives. Some people experience serious health problems, and their poor health has a very negative impact on their life. Some people have serious health problems that last for a long time, and others have serious health problems that resolve very quickly. Many people fall somewhere in the middle—they’re generally in good health, though the occasional problem may come up. Mental health is the same way. \n Just as someone who feels unwell may not have a serious illness, people may have poor mental health without a mental illness. We all have days where we feel a bit down, or stressed out, or overwhelmed by something that’s happening in our lives. An important part of good mental health is the ability to look at problems or concerns realistically. Good mental health isn’t about feeling happy and confident 100% of time and ignoring any problems. It’s about living and coping well despite problems. \n Just as it’s possible to have poor mental health but no mental illness, it’s entirely possible to have good mental health even with a diagnosis of a mental illness. That’s because mental illnesses (like other health problems) are often episodic, meaning there are times (‘episodes’) of ill health and times of better or good health. \n With the right supports and tools, anyone can live well—however they define well—and find meaning, contribute to their communities, and work towards their goals."

   "Questions": "What’s the difference between anxiety and an anxiety disorder?",
   "Answers": "Anxiety is a normal reaction to many different kinds of events and situations in our lives. Anxiety is one of our internal warning systems that alerts us to danger or other threats and prepares our bodies to fight back or get out of a dangerous situation. (Scientists call this the ‘fight, flight, or freeze’ response.) \n A manageable amount of anxiety from time to time can be helpful. For example, it can motivate you to prepare for a test a school or finish a task at work. Even happy events like moving to a new home or celebrating an important milestone can bring up anxiety—all of this is just part of being human. \n Anxiety is a problem when it becomes overwhelming or unmanageable and it comes up unexpectedly. Anxiety disorders are mental illnesses that have a big impact your life. People may avoid going about their daily lives in order to avoid anxiety. They may experience a lot of uncomfortable physical sensations and physical health problems. Many people say that they know their anxiety isn’t based in reality, but they feel ‘trapped’ by their thought and feelings. Anxiety disorders can be treated. It’s important to seek help if you’re concerned about anxiety in your life. \n Normal anxiety... \n Is related to a specific situation or problem \n Lasts only as long as the situation or problem/p> \n Is proportional to the situation or problem/p> \n Is a realistic response to a realistic problem or situation/p> \n When someone experiences an anxiety disorder... \n Anxiety may come up unexpectedly, for seemingly no reason \n The anxiety response to a situation or problem may be much stronger that they would expect \n They may experience a lot of unrealistic anxiety, such as fear of a situation that likely will never happen \n Anxiety may last for a long time, even when the situation or problem has been resolved \n Anxiety may feel impossible to control or manage \n They may avoid situations or things that they believe to trigger anxiety symptoms \n Here’s an example of normal anxiety and an anxiety disorder. Many people are a bit nervous about flying, which is a totally normal reaction. Yet, if they have to travel for work, they can can get on a plane without any problems. Someone with an anxiety disorder, on the other hand, may not be able to travel to the airport—even if it puts their job in jeopardy. \n *Formerly classified as an anxiety disorder and currently classified as Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders **Formerly classified as an anxiety disorder and currently classified as Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders For more information on anxiety, visit https://healthy.ucdavis.edu/mental-emotional/resource-library/common-issues/anxiety"

   "Questions": "What's the difference between anxiety and stress?",
   "Answers": "Stress and anxiety are often used interchangeably, and there is overlap between stress and anxiety. Stress is related to the same ‘fight, flight, or freeze’ response as anxiety, and the physical sensations of anxiety and stress may be very similar. \n The cause of stress and anxiety are usually different, however. Stress focuses on mainly external pressures on us that we’re finding hard to cope with. When we are stressed, we usually know what we’re stressed about, and the symptoms of stress typically disappear after the stressful situation is over. \n Anxiety, on the other hand, isn’t always as easy to figure out. Anxiety focuses on worries or fears about things that could threaten us, as well as anxiety about the anxiety itself. Stress and anxiety are both part of being human, but both can be problems if they last for a long time or have an impact on our well-being or daily life.

   "Questions": "What's the difference between sadness and depression?",
   "Answers": "Sadness is a normal reaction to a loss, disappointment, problems, or other difficult situations. Feeling sad from time to time is just another part of being human. In these cases, feelings of sadness go away quickly and you can go about your daily life. \n Other ways to talk about sadness might be ‘feeling low,’ ‘feeling down,’ or ‘feeling blue.’ A person may say they are feeling ‘depressed,’ but if it goes away on its own and doesn’t impact life in a big way, it probably isn’t the illness of depression. \n Depression is a mental illness that affects your mood, the way you understand yourself, and the way you understand and relate to things around you. It can also go by different names, such as clinical depression, major depressive disorder, or major depression. Depression can come up for no reason, and it lasts for a long time. It’s much more than sadness or low mood. People who experience depression may feel worthless or hopeless. They may feel unreasonable guilty. Some people may experience depression as anger or irritability. It may be hard to concentrate or make decisions. Most people lose interest in things that they used to enjoy and may isolate themselves from others. There are also physical signs of depression, such as problems with sleep, appetite and energy and unexplainable aches or pains. Some may experience difficult thoughts about death or ending their life (suicide). Depression lasts longer than two weeks, doesn’t usually go away on its own, and impacts your life. It’s a real illness, and it is very treatable. It’s important to seek help if you’re concerned about depression.

   "Answers": "Dysthymia, now called persistent depressive disorder or PDD, is a mood disorder. It is related depression (major depressive disorder). The difference between the two is in the number of symptoms and the amount of time that they last. Someone diagnosed with PDD would experience two to four of the symptoms below for at least two years with no periods of wellness during that time, while someone diagnosed with major depressive disorder would experience five or more of the symptoms below for at least two weeks. \n Symptoms of PDD include: \n There is a myth that PDD is not as severe an illness as major depressive disorder, but research shows that the disability of the illness, like the ability to work productively and enjoy hobbies, may be as severe in PDD as it is in major depressive disorder. As PDD involves a smaller number of symptoms that last for a very long time, many people begin to assume PDD is just part of their personality rather than an illness that can be effectively treated. So you should most certainly talk to a doctor or mental health professional if you think you might have PDD.

Someone with ASPD may disregard laws or expectations, lack remorse when they hurt others or break the law, make reckless decisions, and believe they are superior to others. People may see someone with ASPD as overly dramatic, impulsive, manipulative, and deceitful. Some people may appear charming, at least on the surface. Like all mental illnesses, antisocial personality disorder is a spectrum. Some people may only occasionally act out, while others may break the law often and spend a lot of time in the criminal justice system. \n ASPD is only diagnosed in adults, but people with ASPD start to have problems with conduct or antisocial behaviours at a young age. They may be diagnosed with conduct disorder during childhood. \n Treatment for antisocial personality disorder, usually psychotherapy, can help reduce the harms of ASPD and help people build empathy towards others.

   "Answers": "A personality disorder is a pattern of thoughts, feelings, and behaviours that last for a long time and causes some sort of problem or distress. \n Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder or OCPD is about control. People with OCPD have very inflexible thinking and expect everything to be ordered, perfect, and done their \"correct\" way. This happens at the expense of other important things in life, including relationships with others. Work can take priority over every other part of life, too, and people with OCPD may seem excessively dedicated, but may be unable to complete tasks due to perfectionism. They may struggle to delegate and may distrust other people’s contributions. People with OCPD may not tolerate uncertainty and may have a very rigid understanding of the world—something is either right or wrong. They may also have a hard time spending money on themselves or others, and they may experience hoarding, the inability to throw away items from their homes. The conflict between the desire for neatness or order and the inability to throw things out may cause a lot of anxiety. \n While obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have a similar name, they are not the same illness. People with obsessive-compulsive disorder usually understand that their obsessions and compulsions are illogical and usually experience a lot of distress, even though they may not be able to stop obsessions or compulsions. Compulsions are an attempt to reduce anxiety, not to find pleasure. People with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder may view their thoughts as part of who they are, see their thoughts as logical, and may find pleasure or benefit in completing compulsive tasks. They may experience a lot of distress when they can’t achieve control or the perfectionism they want. \n Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is one of the most common personality disorders. Treatment may include some combination of psychotherapy, medication, and self-help strategies.

   "Questions": "What is binge-eating disorder?",
   "Answers": "Binge-eating disorder or BED is a type of eating disorder. It involves episodes of eating a lot of food in a short amount of time, past the point of feeling full, and feelings of being out of control or unable to stop eating. People who experience binge-eating disorder may binge even when they don’t feel hungry. They may feel temporarily comforted by food, and then feel depressed, upset, guilty, or ashamed of their eating. As a result, many people try to keep binge-eating symptoms a secret. You can’t tell if someone experiences binge-eating disorder just from the way they look or the way they eat around others. \n While a lot of people have the experience of eating too much a few times and feeling uncomfortable after, people who experience binge-eating disorder experience many binges for a long period of time. \n Binge-eating disorder is treatable. Talk to your doctor or a mental health professional if you think you might have binge-eating disorder.

   "Questions": "What’s the difference between dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality disorder) and schizophrenia?",
   "Answers": "Sometimes, people confuse dissociative identity disorder, formerly known as multiple personality disorder, and schizophrenia. Schizophrenia does mean “split mind,” but the name was meant to describe the ‘split’ from reality that you experience during an episode of psychosis, as well as changes in thoughts, emotions, and other functions. Dissociative identity disorder, on the other hand, does cause a split or fragmented understanding of a person’s sense of themselves. \n Dissociative identity disorder is really more about fragmented identities than many different personalities that develop on their own. Most people see different parts of their being as part of the whole person. For people who experience DID, identity fragments may have very different characteristics, including their own history, identity, and mannerisms. A key part of DID is dissociation—feeling detached to the world around you. People who experience DID may have many unexplainable gaps in their memory, forget information they’re already learned, or have difficulties recalling things they’ve said or done. Unlike portrayals of DID on TV or in movies, DID may not be obvious to others, and it can take a lot of time to come to the diagnosis. \n Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that causes hallucinations (sensations that aren’t real) and delusions (beliefs that can’t possibly be true, in addition to other symptoms like jumbled thoughts, jumbled speech, and difficulties expressing emotions. People who experience schizophrenia may hear or feel things that aren’t real or believe things that can’t be real, but these aren’t separate identities.  If you or your friend are struggling with mental health and you are concerned call 530-752-2349, a 24 hour hotline for Davis students. For more information, you could also contact SHCS Counseling Services or talk with an advice nurse at no additional cost. "

   "Questions": "What's the difference between psychosis and schizophrenia?",
   "Answers": "Psychosis is a syndrome or group of symptoms. Someone experiencing an episode of psychosis is having a ‘break’ with reality. Major symptoms of psychosis are hallucinations and delusions. Hallucinations are sensations that are not real, such as hearing voices or sounds that aren’t real. Hearing voices is a common hallucination, but hallucinations can be experiences with any sense—hearing, sight, smell, taste, or touch. Delusions are strong beliefs that can’t possibly be true. Common delusions include the belief that someone is following or monitoring you, or the belief that you have extraordinary powers or abilities. Other symptoms of psychosis include difficulties concentrating, completing tasks, or making decisions. Thoughts may feel ‘jumbled’ or confused. Some people have a hard time following conversations or speaking clearly. Psychosis can even affect the way people move or express their emotions. \n Schizophrenia is a mental illness that causes psychosis, but schizophrenia also has other symptoms. And it isn’t the only cause of psychosis. In some cases, other mental illnesses cause psychosis, including depression, bipolar disorder, dementia and borderline personality disorder. Psychosis may come up during times of extreme stress, a major lack of sleep, or trauma. People who are using or withdrawing from certain drugs or medications may experience psychosis. Psychosis may also be caused by a brain injury, neurological problem, or other health problem. So while psychosis can be a part of schizophrenia, it can be caused by many other things too. \n Psychosis and schizophrenia are treatable. It’s important to seek help as soon as possible. \nHere's a resource provided by UC Davis: https://health.ucdavis.edu/psychiatry/specialties/edapt/edapt_clinic.html"

Positive symptoms include hallucinations (sensations that aren’t real), delusions (beliefs that can’t be real), and repetitive movements that are hard to control. \n Negative symptoms take away. Negative symptoms include the inability to show emotions, apathy, difficulties talking, and withdrawing from social situations and relationships. \n There is also a third group of symptoms, usually called cognitive symptoms. This includes anything related to thinking, such as disorganized thoughts, memory problems, and difficulties with focus and attention.\nIf you think you might have schizophrenia, visit this UC Davis resource: https://shcs.ucdavis.edu/health-topic/adhd-attention-deficit-hyperactive-disorders"

   "Answers": "Prodrome is a medical term for early signs or symptoms of an illness or health problem that appear before the major signs or symptoms start. \n Psychosis, a group of symptoms found in disorders like schizophrenia, is one illness with a specific prodrome. With psychosis, prodrome signs and symptoms start before full symptoms like hallucinations and delusions appear. \n Common symptoms in the prodrome of psychosis include: \n These symptoms are found in many other mental illnesses, so it isn’t always clear at the time if this is a prodrome of psychosis or schizophrenia or something else. It’s best to seek help whenever you are concerned about your mental health or a loved one’s mental health.

   "Answers": "While we think of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder as an illness that affects children, it can last into adulthood—and some people aren’t diagnosed until much later in life. \n ADHD is diagnosed like any other mental illness, so your family doctor is a good place to start. Your family doctor may be able to assess your mental health and start treatment, if needed, or they may refer you to more specialized mental health services. \nUC Davis does not perform evaluations or prescribe medication for ADHD, so it is recommended to connect with local providers. \nHere is a helpful resource for finding healthcare providers nearby: https://book.zocdoc.com/get-started?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc_generic&utm_campaign=19162858232&utm_term=doctor%20near%20me&utm_content=144582719655&gclid=CjwKCAjwl6OiBhA2EiwAuUwWZfT7cfF8T1K8JEjC15IUe8G2V_sN97lo5DUP6nmXYhX853Dbv5O4oBoCKR4QAvD_BwE\nHere's more about UC Davis and ADHD: https://shcs.ucdavis.edu/health-topic/adhd-attention-deficit-hyperactive-disorders"

   "Question_ID": 4824231,
   "Questions": "What’s the difference between substance use and addiction?",
   "Answers": "People tend to use the word “addiction” to mean very different things. “I am addicted to shopping” might mean only that the speaker likes to shop. On the other hand, “He is addicted” might mean the speaker thinks the other person is completely unable to control his own behaviour. When people use the word about psychoactive (mind-altering) substances like alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs, they often assume these drugs are dangerous and have the power to control human behaviour. \n The evidence, however, suggests a quite different picture. While substance use can clearly contribute to health and social problems, substances can be beneficial for some people in some situations. Many people celebrate a special occasion with a nice glass of wine, for example. Some people use tobacco as a powerful symbol in cultural and spiritual ceremonies. In fact, substances have been used by humans throughout history for many reasons: to feel good, to feel better, to improve performance, for cultural/spiritual reasons, and to have new experiences. \n Substance use is more complicated than just “good” or “bad.” It’s helpful to think of substance use along a continuum, from beneficial use to harmful use. Along the middle of the continuum, substance use may be both beneficial and harmful. You have an enjoyable night out with friends, but feel a little ill the next day. At the far end of the continuum, some people develop dependence—they need to continually use the drug in order to feel normal and will keep using even when that leads to financial difficulties, problems at home or at work, health problems, or legal problems. \n In general, substance use is a problem when it causes problems for you or others—and how much use causes problems will be different for different people in different situations. The reason a person uses a substance influences the risk of developing problems. For instance, if a person uses a substance to have fun, only occasional social use may follow. But when a person uses a substance to cope with a long-term problem such as social anxiety, then more long lasting and intense use may follow. Managing our risk involves being aware of why we are using and what impacts our use is having on ourselves and those around us. The wisdom of our ancestors suggests a guiding principle—not too much, not too often, and only in safe contexts.\nIf you are seeking help or more information on substance abuse or addiction, here's a helpful UC Davis resource: https://shcs.ucdavis.edu/health-and-wellness/alcohol-tobacco-and-other-drugs/recovery-resources"

   "Answers": "Seeking to make changes in the way you use substances like alcohol or other drugs? This can be an important step! \n Some people are able to reduce their substance use or quit altogether on their own or with self-help materials. But most of us need support from other people—family members, friends, health professionals, or other people struggling with substance use problems. The right help for you depends on many factors. These include the type of drug you are using, how much and how often, your health and social situation and, of course, your own preferences.

   "Question_ID": 7807643,
   "Questions": "If cannabis is dangerous, why are we legalizing it?",
   "Answers": "Cannabis smoke, for example, contains cancer-causing toxins. However, the risk of developing some cancers (e.g., mouth, tongue and lung) is less for cannabis smokers than tobacco smokers, partly because they tend to smoke less than tobacco users. And, while all drugs have an effect on the brain, the particular properties of the drug influence the level of risk of harmful consequences. The negative effects of cannabis on the brain, for example, seem to be less than the effects of some substances such as alcohol. \n Legalizing cannabis provides an opportunity to put in place regulations to minimize potential harms. The danger of buying and using any illegal drug is that we can never know for sure what exactly is in it. Cannabis is legal in Califorinia as of 2016. \n When drugs are produced and obtained inside a regulated system, it is possible for us to know about the contents and dosage of what we are taking. This helps us manage the risks. However, it is likely that cannabis will still be available outside the government system. It is important to know that the quality of cannabis obtained from a dealer or a friend is unknown and may contain contaminants like mold, mildew, or fillers that may be toxic. \n The legalization of cannabis also provides us with openings to engage in honest and thoughtful discussions about drug use with our families and communities. When dealing with complex issues, like cannabis policy, no one has all the answers. But as community members, we all have thoughts, feelings and experiences around drugs and drug use to share with each other. Engaging together to explore and share ideas will help us discover how to manage use, as individuals and communities, in ways that maximize benefit and minimize harm. \n Here are some UC Davis policies on marijuana: https://shcs.ucdavis.edu/health-and-wellness/alcohol-tobacco-and-other-drugs/marijuana/policy"

   "Question_ID": 4352464,
   "Questions": "How can I convince my kids not to use drugs?",
   "Answers": "You can't. But you can influence their capacity to make good choices in a world where alcohol and other drugs are available. It's about helping your child develop the skills to assess what might be helpful in achieving their goals in life. It's also about nourishing a supportive relationship, so they know where to go with questions or problems. \n Opening up a discussion about drugs can help strengthen your relationship with your child. Inviting and allowing open, honest conversation about drugs (or any other subject) makes your child know that what they are thinking, feeling and experiencing matters to you. The goal is to get your child talking and sharing their thoughts and feelings. \n When young people are asked thoughtful, open-ended questions exploring what they think, it helps them become interested in their own thoughts and behaviour. This process of self-reflection is part of developing critical thinking skills, a part of good decision-making. Critical thinking skills are actually an essential part of reducing the risks related to using drugs. Once young people have considered something carefully, they are a lot less likely to act out of impulse or in response to influence. \n There is no rule about how or where a conversation about alcohol or other drugs should start. Even young children know drugs are a part of our culture. They see people drinking around them and are exposed to drugs on TV and in advertising. This makes it a subject that can be brought up naturally while getting ready for a family celebration where alcohol will be present, or if you are planning to visit a relative who uses tobacco, or while swapping stories at the dinner table about what happened at work and school that day. \n Talking with teens and young adults about drugs as they make choices on the path into adulthood helps them to develop personal standards, minimize risks and critically assess popular beliefs about drug use. This can be particularly important as they transition to the legal age for using alcohol or cannabis and move out of the family home. While young adults have more independence and more legal rights, parents can continue to be an important sounding board on which to try out their thoughts and ideas. "

   "Question_ID": 6521784,
   "Questions": "What is the legal status (and evidence) of CBD oil?",
   "Answers": "Cannabidiol or CBD is a naturally occurring component of cannabis. It is extracted from the cannabis plant and often made into an oil for use. CBD is not psychoactive, and does not produce the ‘high’ of THC (tetrahyrocannabinol), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. CBD is legal in Canada and has been used in the treatment of various medical conditions. \n All cannabinoids, including CBD, produce effects in the body by attaching to certain receptors in the brain or immune system. The human body also produces its own cannabinoids. It seems that CBD does not attach directly to receptors. Instead, it directs the body to use more of its own cannabinoids to produce the therapeutic effects associated with CBD. \n Research suggests that CBD may provide relief for chronic pain. Sativex is a proprietary medication that combines THC and CBD and may be prescribed for the relief of pain associated with multiple sclerosis. There is also some evidence suggesting that CBD may be a promising support for people with opioid use disorders. The researchers noted that CBD reduced some symptoms associated with substance use disorders including anxiety, mood-related symptoms, pain, and insomnia. \n After researching the safety and effectiveness of CBD oil for treating epilepsy, in 2018, the United States FDA approved CBD (Epidiolex) as a therapy for two rare conditions characterized by epileptic seizures. Other evidence suggests that CBD may be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia, though further research is needed before introducing CBD into medical practice. \n There is some initial evidence that CBD may help people in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease keep the ability to recognize the faces of people that they know, and thus slow progression of the illness. Again, more research is needed in this area. \n Because of the way cannabis and its products are metabolized, scientists believe there is a potential for interaction with other drugs, although nothing significant has yet been recorded. CBD has been found to be generally safe. Reports from patients indicate that negative drug interactions are not common. As with any other treatment, it is important to monitor your use of CBD and seek assistance if you experience any problems or have questions or concerns about its use. \n"

   "Questions": "What is the evidence on vaping?",
   "Answers": "\"Vaping\" is the term for using a device where liquids, often flavoured, are turned into vapour (hence, vaping) and inhaled. A vaping device consists of a mouthpiece, tank or reservoir to hold the liquid, a heating element and a battery to power the element. The liquid is heated to become a mist, inhaled through the mouth into the lungs where the nicotine or cannabis enters the bloodstream. Any residual vapour is exhaled. Vaping devices come in several types, shapes, and sizes, referred to as e-cigarettes, vape pens, vapes, mods, tanks, or e-hookahs. Vaping liquid (e-liquid, e-juice) consists of a solvent, usually propylene glycol or glycerol, flavour, and nicotine or cannabis, though it may not contain anything. In California you must be 21 years old to buy vaping products, as of December 2022. \n The number of young people who smoke cigarettes has declined over the past few years, while vaping has increased. E-cigarettes were developed as an alternative to smoking. The first devices were available in 2003 and looked much like a traditional cigarette. Nicotine vapour contains significantly fewer toxins and other particles than smoke from cigarettes. Vaping is a less harmful alternative to cigarettes and evidence suggests, it may help some people quit smoking. Evidence suggests vaping is likely not a gateway to smoking tobacco. \n Though less harmful than smoking cigarettes, vaping still carries potential harms. There is a small exposure to nicotine and possible carcinogens in the vapour. (A carcinogen is a substance that has the potential to cause cancer). Some evidence suggests that young people may be unaware the vaping liquid often contains nicotine. E-cigarettes are not controlled and the nicotine content of vaping liquids varies significantly among brands. Other chemicals, flavourings, and heavy metals present in vaping liquids, have not as yet been well studied. Long-term health risks from vaping are thus undetermined. More research is needed in these areas. \n Marketing strategies for vaping products, often on social media, are designed to appeal to young people. The range of flavours available, especially those that are fruity and sweet, and the look and feel of vaping devices attract youth. Young people can see vaping as fun and a way to socialize with friends and 'smoke' in a less harmful way. \n Making the time and space for discussion and exploring the issues around vaping is one important way we can support young people and indeed, each other, in making good decisions about if, when, or how much to vape. We offer, \"not too much, not too often, and in a safe context\" as one way to think about using any substance. What this means to you may be a place for talking to start! \n Here's a helpful resource provided by UC Davis: https://healthy.ucdavis.edu/smoke-tobacco-free/vaping-campaign"

   "Answers": "The quarter system is one of the most intense schedules you will face in your lifetime. It can be overwhelming to think of all the events that occur in the short period of 10 weeks. The amount of complexity that you have to juggle can take a toll on you mentally, emotionally and physically. Two things that many people swear by are meditation and yoga, which can relax your mind and body. Another really useful strategy to help organize your thoughts is journaling. Journaling is great for helping figure out how you are really feeling because it encourages you to be honest with yourself. An additional way to practice self-care is to add some movement into your day. Many people find that getting a short walk or light workout helps them forget about some of their worries and create some endorphins. The most important thing for many people is getting some alone time with yourself because it allows for time to wind down and really reflect on the day. https://mentalhealth.ucdavis.edu/resources/basics"

   "Answers": "Clearly large body of research evidence points to im- portance of lifestyle factors in medical and psychiatric diseases. Research also suggest that positive modifica- tion of lifestyle factors is essential for both improve- ment and maintaining of physical and mental health.\nEach individual is unique and hence requires their own unique set of programmes of lifestyle modification. Indeed, it is helpful to recognise that each lifestyle factor is linked to and influences other lifestyle factors through various underlying mechanisms such as impro- vement in inflammatory processes which can result from inactivity, over consumption of unhealthy/inflam- matory foods, obesity and smoking. Whilst it may be easier to take a step by step approach by modifying of one lifestyle factor at one time, efforts should be made to modify all lifestyle factors in conjunctions, since they tend to work synergistically and are likely to have greater effect on positively modify morbidity and mor- tality related to physical and mental health.

Mental illness can impact how we see ourselves, how we see the world around us and how we interact with the world.\n\nIt’s important to know that it is possible to have good mental health even if you have a mental illness. Just like with other conditions, many people with mental illness experience tough times but they can also have periods of better or good mental health.

   "Questions": "How can social media use impact mental health, and what steps can be taken to manage its effects?",
   "Answers": "A 2018 University of Pennsylvania study found that reducing social media use to 30 minutes a day resulted in a significant reduction in levels of anxiety, depression, loneliness, sleep problems, and FOMO. But you don’t need to cut back on your social media use that drastically to improve your mental health. The same study concluded that just being more mindful of your social media use can have beneficial results on your mood and focus.  \n\nWhile 30 minutes a day may not be a realistic target for many of us—let alone a full “social media detox”— we can still benefit from reducing the amount of time we spend on social media. For most of us, that means reducing how much we use our smartphones. The following tips can help: Use an app to track how much time you spend on social media each day. Then set a goal for how much you want to reduce it by.\nTurn off your phone at certain times of the day, such as when you’re driving, in a meeting, at the gym, having dinner, spending time with offline friends, or playing with your kids. Don’t take your phone with you to the bathroom.\nDon’t bring your phone or tablet to bed. Turn devices off and leave them in another room overnight to charge.\nDisable social media notifications. It’s hard to resist the constant buzzing, beeping, and dinging of your phone alerting you to new messages. Turning off notifications can help you regain control of your time and focus.\nLimit checks. If you compulsively check your phone every few minutes, wean yourself off by limiting your checks to once every 15 minutes. Then once every 30 minutes, then once an hour. There are apps that can automatically limit when you’re able to access your phone.\nTry removing social media apps from your phone so you can only check Facebook, Twitter and the like from your tablet or computer. If this sounds like too drastic a step, try removing one social media app at a time to see how much you really miss it.

   "Answers": "Most pet owners are clear about the immediate joys that come with sharing their lives with companion animals. However, many of us remain unaware of the physical and mental health benefits that can also accompany the pleasure of snuggling up to a furry friend. It’s only recently that studies have begun to scientifically explore the benefits of the human-animal bond.\n\nPets have evolved to become acutely attuned to humans and our behavior and emotions. Dogs, for example, are able to understand many of the words we use, but they’re even better at interpreting our tone of voice, body language, and gestures. And like any good human friend, a loyal dog will look into your eyes to gauge your emotional state and try to understand what you’re thinking and feeling (and to work out when the next walk or treat might be coming, of course).\n\nPets, especially dogs and cats, can reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, ease loneliness, encourage exercise and playfulness, and even improve your cardiovascular health. Caring for an animal can help children grow up more secure and active. Pets also provide valuable companionship for older adults. Perhaps most importantly, though, a pet can add real joy and unconditional love to your life Source: https://www.helpguide.org/articles/mental-health/mood-boosting-power-of-dogs.htm#:~:text=Pets%2C%20especially%20dogs%20and%20cats,valuable%20companionship%20for%20older%20adults."

Myth: You only need to take care of your mental health if you have a mental health condition.\nFact: Everyone can benefit from taking active steps to promote their well-being and improve their mental health. Similarly, everyone can take active steps and engage in healthy habits to optimize their physical health.\n \n\n3. Myth: Poor mental health is not a big issue for teenagers. They just have mood swings caused by hormonal fluctuations and act out due to a desire for attention.\nFact: Teenagers often have mood swings, but that does not mean that adolescents may not also struggle with their mental health. Fourteen per cent of the world’s adolescents experience mental-health problems. Globally, among those aged 10–15, suicide is the fifth most prevalent cause of death, and for adolescents aged 15–19 it is the fourth most common cause. Half of all mental health conditions start by the age of 14.\n \n\n4. Myth: Nothing can be done to protect people from developing mental health conditions.\nFact: Many factors can protect people from developing mental health conditions, including strengthening social and emotional skills, seeking help and support early on, developing supportive, loving, warm family relationships, and having a positive school environment and healthy sleep patterns.\n\nThe ability to overcome adversity relies on a combination of protective factors, and neither environmental nor individual stressors alone will necessarily result in mental health problems. Children and adolescents who do well in the face of adversity typically have biological resistance as well as strong, supportive relationships with family, friends and adults around them, resulting in a combination of protective factors to support well-being.\n \n\n5. Myth: A mental health condition is a sign of weakness; if the person were stronger, they would not have this condition.\nFact: A mental health condition has nothing to do with being weak or lacking willpower. It is not a condition people choose to have or not have. In fact, recognizing the need to accept help for a mental health condition requires great strength and courage. Anyone can develop a mental health condition.\n \n\n6. Myth: Adolescents who get good grades and have a lot of friends will not have mental health conditions because they have nothing to be depressed about.\nFact: Depression is a common mental health condition resulting from a complex interaction of social, psychological, and biological factors. Depression can affect anyone regardless of their socioeconomic status or how good their life appears at face value. Young people doing well in school may feel pressure to succeed, which can cause anxiety, or they may have challenges at home. They may also experience depression or anxiety for no reason that can be easily identified.\n \n\n7. Myth: Bad parenting causes mental conditions in adolescents.\nFact: Many factors – including poverty, unemployment, and exposure to violence, migration, and other adverse circumstances and events – may influence the well-being and mental health of adolescents, their caregivers and the relationship between them. Adolescents from loving, supporting homes can experience mental health difficulties, as can adolescent from homes where there may be caregivers who need support to maintain an optimum environment for healthy adolescent development. With support, caregivers can play an essential role in helping adolescents to overcome any problems they experience.

   "Questions": "What is the connection between physical health and mental health, and how can one impact the other?",
   "Answers": "Mental and physical health is fundamentally linked. There are multiple associations between mental health and chronic physical conditions that significantly impact people’s quality of life, demands on health care and other publicly funded services, and generate consequences to society.  The World Health Organization (WHO) defines: health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.   The WHO states that “there is no health without mental health.”1\nNowhere is the relationship between mental and physical health more evident than in the area of chronic conditions. The associations between mental and physical health are:\n\nPoor mental health is a risk factor for chronic physical conditions.\nPeople with serious mental health conditions are at high risk of experiencing chronic physical conditions.\nPeople with chronic physical conditions are at risk of developing poor mental health.\nThe social determinants of health impact both chronic physical conditions and mental health. Key aspects of prevention include increasing physical activity, access to nutritious foods, ensuring adequate income and fostering social inclusion and social support. This creates opportunities to enhance protective factors and reduce risk factors related to aspects of mental and physical health.\n\nUnderstanding the links between mind and body is the first step in developing strategies to reduce the incidence of co-existing conditions and support those already living with mental illnesses and chronic physical conditions.
