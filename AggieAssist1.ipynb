Here are key points to keep in mind as you determine which information is worth considering and which information doesn\\'t pass the test.\\nIt\\'s so easy to spread information online, and we can\\'t assume that the source we\\'re reading or watching is the original source. Before you can evaluate anything, you need to know where the claims come from and determine if it\\'s a reliable source.\\nReliable sources on the coronavirus and COVID-19 illness include the World Health Organization (WHO), different US governement agencies including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC), and well-known universities (including any in the UC system). Scientists and researchers at universities and other institutions and health sciences professionals are also important sources of information. \\nHeadlines and titles need to be simple and short, so they can sometimes be misleading on their own. They may also be purposefully shocking or controversial to entice you to click to read more. \\nWebsites that belong to governments, government-funded agencies, well-known health providers, universities, or groups of medical professionals are generally the most reliable. Be careful of sites that don\\'t list the author or don\\'t tell you much about themselves. Double-check the author and the credentials of any \\'experts\\' quoted or cited to see if they are actually experts in the topic being discussed. \\nCan you find other evidence from other sources to support the claims? Does the author list their sources? Are the sources legitimate, like research journals? \\nUnhelpful sources want you to feel a certain way: scared, angry, distrustful, vulnerable. Phrases like \"Skyrocketing rates of infection\" are sensational and they\\'re meant to make people feel afraid. On the other hand, factual statements like \"We have 50 new cases in BC\" give you important information without playing into your emotions. Helpful news or information sources want you feel informed and empowered. Who is paying for the site? What products or services are being advertised? What links or other sites do they promote? Are you learning something from a story or experience, or are you simply being directed to buy a product or service? Social media can be a great way to keep in touch with family and friends, especially as we practice physical distancing or self-isolation. Social media can also be an important way to learn from health experts and connect to support services and mutual aid groups in your community. Like any other source of information, it\\'s important to use good critical thinking skills when you use social media. Studies find that searching for health information on social media generally has very mixed results. You\\'ll see both very poor-quality sources next to good-quality sources, and it\\'s up to you to decide which is which. In addition, social media posts tend to be short and rarely capture everything you need to consider. They are generally useful as a way to start learning or exploring different points of view rather than a place to gather all the information.

Antisocial personality disorder or ASPD affects the way people think about the rights of others. Someone with ASPD may disregard laws or expectations, lack remorse when they hurt others or break the law, make reckless decisions, and believe they are superior to others. People may see someone with ASPD as overly dramatic, impulsive, manipulative, and deceitful. Some people may appear charming, at least on the surface. Like all mental illnesses, antisocial personality disorder is a spectrum. Some people may only occasionally act out, while others may break the law often and spend a lot of time in the criminal justice system. ASPD is only diagnosed in adults, but people with ASPD start to have problems with conduct or antisocial behaviours at a young age. They may be diagnosed with conduct disorder during childhood. Treatment for antisocial personality disorder, usually psychotherapy, can help reduce the harms of ASPD and help people build empathy towards others. ASPD is treatable and it may improve as a person approaches middle age. All of us have hurt someone else or acted without thinking of others' needed. It’s important to remember that antisocial personality disorder is an enduring pattern around lack of empathy and lack of remorse.

Antisocial personality disorder or ASPD affects the way people think about the rights of others. Someone with ASPD may disregard laws or expectations, lack remorse when they hurt others or break the law, make reckless decisions, and believe they are superior to others. People may see someone with ASPD as overly dramatic, impulsive, manipulative, and deceitful. Some people may appear charming, at least on the surface. Like all mental illnesses, antisocial personality disorder is a spectrum. Some people may only occasionally act out, while others may break the law often and spend a lot of time in the criminal justice system. ASPD is only diagnosed in adults, but people with ASPD start to have problems with conduct or antisocial behaviours at a young age. They may be diagnosed with conduct disorder during childhood. Treatment for antisocial personality disorder, usually psychotherapy, can help reduce the harms of ASPD and help people build empathy towards others. ASPD is treatable and it may improve as a person approaches middle age. All of us have hurt someone else or acted without thinking of others' needed. It’s important to remember that antisocial personality disorder is an enduring pattern around lack of empathy and lack of remorse. Only a doctor or mental health professional can diagnose illnesses like ASPD. To find help for antisocial personality disorder, talk to your family doctor.

Work can take priority over every other part of life, too, and people with OCPD may seem excessively dedicated, but may be unable to complete tasks due to perfectionism.

The conflict between the desire for neatness or order and the inability to throw things out may cause a lot of anxiety.

Schizophrenia does mean “split mind,” but the name was meant to describe the ‘split’ from reality that you experience during an episode of psychosis, as well as changes in thoughts, emotions, and other functions. Dissociative identity disorder, on the other hand, does cause a split or fragmented understanding of a person’s sense of themselves. Dissociative identity disorder is really more about fragmented identities than many different personalities that develop on their own. Most people see different parts of their being as part of the whole person. For people who experience DID, identity fragments may have very different characteristics, including their own history, identity, and mannerisms. A key part of DID is dissociation—feeling detached to the world around you. People who experience DID may have many unexplainable gaps in their memory, forget information they’re already learned, or have difficulties recalling things they’ve said or done. Unlike portrayals of DID on TV or in movies, DID may not be obvious to others, and it can take a lot of time to come to the diagnosis. Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that causes hallucinations (sensations that aren’t real) and delusions (beliefs that can’t possibly be true, in addition to other symptoms like jumbled thoughts, jumbled speech, and difficulties expressing emotions.

Research also suggest that positive modification of lifestyle factors is essential for both improvement and maintaining of physical and mental health. Each individual is unique and hence requires their own unique set of programmes of lifestyle modification. Indeed, it is helpful to recognise that each lifestyle factor is linked to and influences other lifestyle factors through various underlying mechanisms such as improvement in inflammatory processes which can result from inactivity, overconsumption of unhealthy/inflammatory foods, obesity and smoking. Whilst it may be easier to take a step by step approach by modifying of one lifestyle factor at one time, efforts should be made to modify all lifestyle factors in conjunctions, since they tend to work synergistically and are likely to have greater effect on positively modify morbidity and mortality related to physical and mental health.

Here are key points to keep in mind as you determine which information is worth considering and which information doesn't pass the test.\\nIt's so easy to spread information online, and we can't assume that the source we're reading or watching is the original source. Before you can evaluate anything, you need to know where the claims come from and determine if it's a reliable source.\\nReliable sources on the coronavirus and COVID-19 illness include the World Health Organization (WHO), different US governement agencies including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC), and well-known universities (including any in the UC system). Scientists and researchers at universities and other institutions and health sciences professionals are also important sources of information. \\nHeadlines and titles need to be simple and short, so they can sometimes be misleading on their own. They may also be purposefully shocking or controversial to entice you to click to read more. \\nWebsites that belong to governments, government-funded agencies, well-known health providers, universities, or groups of medical professionals are generally the most reliable. Be careful of sites that don't list the author or don't tell you much about themselves. Double-check the author and the credentials of any 'experts' quoted or cited to see if they are actually experts in the topic being discussed. \\nCan you find other evidence from other sources to support the claims? Does the author list their sources? Are the sources legitimate, like research journals? \\nUnhelpful sources want you to feel a certain way: scared, angry, distrustful, vulnerable. Phrases like \\\"Skyrocketing rates of infection\\\" are sensational and they're meant to make people feel afraid. On the other hand, factual statements like \\\"We have 50 new cases in BC\\\" give you important information without playing into your emotions. Helpful news or information sources want you feel informed and empowered. Who is paying for the site? What products or services are being advertised? What links or other sites do they promote? Are you learning something from a story or experience, or are you simply being directed to buy a product or service? Social media can be a great way to keep in touch with family and friends, especially as we practice physical distancing or self-isolation. Social media can also be an important way to learn from health experts and connect to support services and mutual aid groups in your community. Like any other source of information, it's important to use good critical thinking skills when you use social media. Studies find that searching for health information on social media generally has very mixed results. You'll see both very poor-quality sources next to good-quality sources, and it's up to you to decide which is which. In addition, social media posts tend to be short and rarely capture everything you need to consider. They are generally useful as a way to start learning or exploring different points of view rather than a place to gather all the information. Visit www.mediasmarts.ca to learn more about digital and media literacy. Visit www.healthnewsreview.org to learn more about thinking critically around health claims (this resource is no longer updated daily, but all toolkits and lessons are still available).

It's up to the readers to think critically about information to decide if it seems helpful, truthful, or safe. Here are key points to keep in mind as you determine which information is worth considering and which information doesn't pass the test.\\nIt's so easy to spread information online, and we can't assume that the source we're reading or watching is the original source. Before you can evaluate anything, you need to know where the claims come from and determine if it's a reliable source.\\nReliable sources on the coronavirus and COVID-19 illness include the World Health Organization (WHO), different US governement agencies including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC), and well-known universities (including any in the UC system). Scientists and researchers at universities and other institutions and health sciences professionals are also important sources of information. \\nHeadlines and titles need to be simple and short, so they can sometimes be misleading on their own. They may also be purposefully shocking or controversial to entice you to click to read more. \\nWebsites that belong to governments, government-funded agencies, well-known health providers, universities, or groups of medical professionals are generally the most reliable. Be careful of sites that don't list the author or don't tell you much about themselves. Double-check the author and the credentials of any 'experts' quoted or cited to see if they are actually experts in the topic being discussed. \\nCan you find other evidence from other sources to support the claims? Does the author list their sources? Are the sources legitimate, like research journals? \\nUnhelpful sources want you to feel a certain way: scared, angry, distrustful, vulnerable. Phrases like \\\"Skyrocketing rates of infection\\\" are sensational and they're meant to make people feel afraid. On the other hand, factual statements like \\\"We have 50 new cases in BC\\\" give you important information without playing into your emotions. Helpful news or information sources want you feel informed and empowered. Who is paying for the site? What products or services are being advertised? What links or other sites do they promote? Are you learning something from a story or experience, or are you simply being directed to buy a product or service? Social media can be a great way to keep in touch with family and friends, especially as we practice physical distancing or self-isolation. Social media can also be an important way to learn from health experts and connect to support services and mutual aid groups in your community. Like any other source of information, it's important to use good critical thinking skills when you use social media. Studies find that searching for health information on social media generally has very mixed results. You'll see both very poor-quality sources next to good-quality sources, and it's up to you to decide which is which. In addition, social media posts tend to be short and rarely capture everything you need to consider. They are generally useful as a way to start learning or exploring different points of view rather than a place to gather all the information.
